              ANNUAL LEAVE AND PUBLIC/BANK HOLIDAYS

            <p>
              Your holiday year begins on 1st April and ends on 31st March each
              year, during which you will receive a paid holiday entitlement of
              28 days inclusive of any public/bank holidays which you may choose
              to request. Entitlements are pro-rata for part-time employees. In
              your first holiday year your entitlement will be proportionate to
              the amount of time left in the holiday year. Conditions relating
              to the taking of holidays are shown in the Employee Handbook to
              which you should refer. However, because of the nature of our
              business you may be required to work on any of the public/bank
              holidays listed below, and it is a condition of employment that
              you work on these days when required to do so. If you are required
              to work on any of these days you will be given an alternative day
              of leave in lieu. The date when a day off in lieu is to be taken
              is to be mutually agreed with us.

              month of service during that holiday year and any holidays accrued
              but not taken will be paid for and must be taken as part of your

                CLAUSE 7 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

              <p>
                It is anticipated that in the course of the employeeâs duties
                they may make or discover intellectual property and, in this
                respect,, they have a special obligation to further the
                interests of the Company.
              </p>
              <p>
                Intellectual property includes patents, registered or
                unregistered trademarks and designs, utility models, copyrights,
                including design copyrights, applications for any of the
                foregoing and the right to apply for them in any part of the
                world, discoveries, creations, inventions or improvements upon
                or additions to an invention, confidential information, know-how
                and any research relating to the above, business names, whether
                registerable or not, moral rights and any similar rights in any
                country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subject to the provisions of the Patents Act 1977 and the
                Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, if any time during the
                employeeâs employment they make or discover or participate in
                the making or discovery of any intellectual property relating to
                or capable of being used in the business carried on by the
                Company, the employee must communicate the details forthwith to
                the Company and such intellectual property will be the absolute
                property of the Company. At the Companyâs request and expense,
                the employee must give and supply all such information, data,
                drawings and assistance as may be necessary to enable the
                Company to exploit the intellectual property to best advantage,
                and must execute all documents and do such things as may be
                necessary or desirable for obtaining patent and other protection
                for the intellectual property in such parts of the world as may
                be specified by the Company and for vesting the same in our
                Company or as they may direct.
              </p>
              <p>
                The employee irrevocably appoints the Company in their name and
                on their behalf to sign and execute such instruments and do such
                things and generally to use their name for the purposes of
                giving to the Company (or their nominees) the full benefit of
                the provisions of this clause. A certificate in writing signed
                by the Company that an instrument or act falls within the
                authority conferred by this clause will be conclusive evidence
                that such is the case.
              </p>
              <p>
                If while in the employment of the Company the employee makes, or
                discovers intellectual property which does not become the
                property of the Company then, subject to the provisions of the
                Patents Act 1977, the Company will have the right to acquire for
                themselves or their nominee the employeeâs right therein on fair
                and reasonable terms, to be agreed or settled by a single
                arbitrator appointed by the President of Chartered Institute of
                Arbitrators who shall adjudicate at our joint expense.

                The rights and obligations arising under this clause will
                continue to have full force and effect after the employeeâs
                employment has terminated and will be binding upon their
                representatives.
